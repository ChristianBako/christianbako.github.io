# DEPRECATED 

I decided to move to something hosted on a more modern stack because of limits on gh pages. Keeping this around just for fun.

Wow it's annoying how GH doesn't let you know when it's deploying huh? 

I lied it does but it's a little hidden if you don't know what to look for. 

This is mostly a playground for me to learn about frontend, so for god sake don't copy anything I do here.
