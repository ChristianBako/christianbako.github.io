title:  "Becoming a Founding Engineer is a Bad Deal"
---
All Content + """thought leadership"""[^1] is advertising. The naive public internet is over. Every agent posting things on the massive platforms you're likely to see them is jockeying for your attention for some downstream economic effect.[^2] This is doubly true when someone has a direct financial interest in getting you to believe what they're saying. The only line between that and gas lighting is that often the venture capital class believes what they're saying.[^3]

Speaking of people who have a financial incentive to have you believe what they're saying, let's talk about Founders! 

The intrepid weirdly thin skinned class of Entrepreneurs that bring us things like Airbnb, Juciero and the worlds 5th GPT wrapper app. Our wunderkin can't do all the work themselves though, they need someone to do lots of the foundational work required to get something from the MVP stage to the MLP stage and beyond.[^1]

Those people can't be blessed with the founder title though, that would entitle them to double digit equity. Yet a new founder can't pay enough to compete with other startups let alone FAANG companies. 

So we end up with the Founding Engineer title to make what sucker they do hire feel better about leaving their FAANG job on the table. 

They were **so** close to being a founder, if only they had been a part of the company a week or two earlier maybe they would even have been!

The responsibilities of a founding engineer are broadly:

## Who are the people who do this job? 

In my experiance founding engineers, and early stage employees break down into the following groups. 

The Unhirables 
Rejected for whatever reason from a more traditional job. This can be for good and bad reasons. Requires too much agency, antisocial, no experiance etc. 

The Fiscally Illiterate 
Honestly believe that they're going to get a big payday, and working at a startup is the way to do it. 

The True Believers
Passionate about the space/product. Mostly in video games, charity, and Musk's projects.
# Compensation curves
Let's take a look at likely compensation curves from working at these. 
## Founding Engineer 
### The most likely case
The two 20-25 year olds who've never managed anything beyond their rowing club at Yale commit a litiny of employment violations while trying to revolutionize. 

You spend a year or two grinding through some pivots, spending a majority of your salary on rent punctuated by sad trips to the brownest costal trails you've ever seen before the company goes bankrupt.
### The walking dead case
You make that salary for 3-5 years, company raises some money, makes some money, but never actually takes off. 

Equity expires mostly worthless, wooho! 
### The Unicorn case
You avoid dilution, clawbacks, getting fired, and all the fun of startups life. The statup does really really well, we're talking 1% or better of startups and becomes a unicorn! 

Congratulations, you're now a deca millionaire, and you just IPOed after 10 years of hard work! There's now liquidity from the average robin-hood user. 

You can afford a decent house in the Bay and some extra cash on top. 

Your annual TC was 1 mil, easily achievable as a staff at a big tech company, with maybe 10% of the effort?
### The Google case
Somehow you own something like 1% of a true outlier company like Google, you're a billionaire and can do silly billionaire things.

Annual TC is effectively âˆž
## Big Tech/Later Stage Startup 
The most available career path and the best documented. 
Lifetime earnings over 20 years: 150k-1mil per year + equity compensation. 
### The likely case

### The "I worked as hard as I did at a startup and became Sundar Pichai" case

There's a lot of talk in 

## Founder case

# Conclusion
I understand this sounds like I'm looking at every 18-25 year old in tech and telling them that, "Hey you should put on pants and get a real job at Meta", I'm not.

I like startups and personally I'd like to found one. They're the growth engine that powers SV, the United States, and the world. 

I am not a "Wow SV is dumb, and only filled with idiots funding stupid bullshit we already have" Warren voting NYC/DC liberal. 

I, naively, believe in the myth of SV and the insane power of startups as an institution. 

That doesn't stop my immense frustration when I see founders and the VC ecosystem talk their book constantly with no one really pushing back. 

VCs are fully derisked because their strategy involves them investing in many startups and making money on the inevitable outliers. They don't care about your personal outcome, even if their marketing material convinces you they do. 

Let's be real, anyone who is going to be great founding engineer would do just as well as a full founder. It requires the same amount of grit, dedication, technical skills etc. 

The only difference between most founders and their initial engineers is their ability to pass the VC smell test, half the time by coming in from somewhere like a prestigious college. 

With something like YC a startup probably pivoted and is hiring founding engineers after building a new MVP for a few weeks.

That's not a special sauce that's unique enough to justify 10x rewards.

Especially as the market has softened since 2021-2022, they've gone full mask off with what they think of anyone below the Founders in the org chart. 

Software engineers in my experiance are conflict avoidant about things they do not understand, particularly when it comes to things that involve other people and not software. 

The people running the median startup aren't functioning as engineers, they're business people. When you run a business whose main cost is expensive labor you are always looking for ways to skimp. These people are **not** your friends, they're your **boss** and they they're giving you a bad deal so they can make more money.

If you take one of these gigs for your own reasons, I don't care. 
As long as you know the person giving you that job is probably screwing you because you're financially illiterate.

I am always open to changing my mind, but the numbers speak for themselves.

Anyone who is successful as a founding engineer would be 10x more successful founding their own startup. It's basically the same skill set, and the differentiable skills are not worth the massive loss in equity. 

You're blowing your lottery tickets so someone else can win the jackpot.
