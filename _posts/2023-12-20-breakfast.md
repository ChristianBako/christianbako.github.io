title: there's something sumptious about breakfast
---

It's the food of hangovers, recently concluded drug binges, good hookups, bad hookups, long hikes, wet dog fur and cold L.L. bean jackets. 

Poorly made rubbery eggs, industrial bacon, weak homemade drip coffee. You already know there's no work to make someone elses excel sheet cells green coming with breakfast. 
Only that you have barely enough time before the, usually, impending pain to cook the cheapest food imaginable at industrial quantiaties for yourself and the people around you. 

There's no omelets meticulously pulled off a seasoned carbon steel pan, mariscone pancakes with cutsie toppings.

It's fuel closer in consitution to an MRE than a real meal. 

It's food that would make a Californian squeal. 

It's unoptimzied, overly processed, American breakfast.
